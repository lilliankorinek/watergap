Bootstrap Website / SMS Twilio DEMO

Here is a link to the wordpress documentation: http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/~lilliankorinek/webdev/index.php/2017/05/16/final-project-twilio-extension/

Here is a link to a Google Drive folder with images for the website:

Due to poor internet connection where I am, I cannot upload large files to github at this time. Download the Google Drive folder and place
a folder called "images" in the "assets" folder next to bootstrap, css and js. This should provide the proper pathway to view the entirety 
of the project. 

To access live server, cd to "watergap" on terminal. Type "npm install"-- the package.json file lists the project's dependencies and will 
automatically install the necessary packages. Next type "node index.js." The site should then be running and terminal should notify you as well.
In Google Chrome type "localhost:3000." The website should show live on your browser.
